1) You can setup a SSH key-pairing to provide a silent auth mechanism, first create a OpenSSH key-pair:

$ ssh-keygen

2) To improve security on this setup, please ensure you provide a password for this key.

Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): ************
Enter same passphrase again: ************

Using ssh-agent, avoid asking the key password over and over again on every Ansible deploy. Ssh-agent will cached your key to be use in further actions, until you logout.

3) Installing public key
After creating the Control machine key, you need to install the public key into every remote hosts, 
copy the content of .ssh/id_rsa.pub of Control machine to .ssh/authorized_keys on your host. Make sure you know the user to store authorized_keys, this will be the user you use for any action via Ansible.

Set the correct permissions:

$ chmod 600 .ssh/authorized_keys

4) Add hosts to control

Adding hosts is easy, just put the hostname or IP Address on /etc/ansible/hosts.

cat /etc/ansible/hosts

[ec2-elasticsearch.southeastasia.cloudapp.azure.com]
hosts1.example.net
hosts2.example.net

Test connection

ansible all -m ping

You will get a output like this.

hosts1.example.net | SUCCESS => {
    "changed": false,
    "ping": "pong"
}
hosts2.example.net | SUCCESS => {
    "changed": false,
    "ping": "pong"
}
